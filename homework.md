  res.cookie("token", token)

- Read the cookies inside your profile API and find the looged in user
  // const cookie = req.cookie; // will not work
  const cookies = req.cookies;

Why Does the Server Attach the JWT Token to a Cookie?
When a user logs in, the server validates the credentials, generates a JWT token, and attaches it to a cookie before sending it to the browser. Here‚Äôs why:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Cookies Store the Token Securely
Instead of storing the JWT in localStorage or sessionStorage, storing it in cookies provides better security:

HTTP-only: The cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript (prevents XSS attacks).

Secure: Only sent over HTTPS, preventing MITM attacks.

Same-Origin Restrictions: Only accessible to the domain that set it.

üìå Summary
‚úÖ Why store JWT in a cookie?

More Secure than localStorage (prevents XSS attacks).

Automatic Handling: Sent with every request, no need for manual headers.

Persistent Sessions: User stays logged in across tabs and refreshes.

CSRF Protection: With SameSite settings.
